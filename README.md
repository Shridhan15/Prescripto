# 🩺 About Prescripto

Prescripto is a **full-stack healthcare appointment and hospital management platform** designed to simplify interactions between **patients, doctors, and hospital administrators**.

The platform provides an intuitive experience for patients to discover specialists, schedule appointments based on doctor availability, securely complete online payments, and manage upcoming consultations.

Doctors receive their own dedicated dashboard where they can manage appointments, monitor earnings, update availability, and maintain their professional profiles.

Administrators have complete control over the platform through a centralized dashboard, allowing them to manage doctors, monitor appointments, oversee hospital operations, and maintain the overall healthcare ecosystem.

The project demonstrates the implementation of a scalable MERN architecture with secure authentication, payment gateway integration, cloud-based media storage, and role-based authorization.
